A directory of non-discriminating projects:

 * **free** to be able to use the tool & material for any purpose
 * **gratis** for those without money
 * **web-based & hosted** for those without their own computer
 * **open-source** downloadable, based on free software
 * **portable** data needs to be easily backed up in open formats
 * **usable** for less technically inclined
 * **anonymous** if viable, no registration necessary

Collecting them makes it  easy to find available projects to use and contribute to – both users and developers profit from that. Everyone can help improve these services, not only by coding or translating but also by using and spreading the word.
Not every project will be listed here, especially not complicated  ones. It’s not about giving many choices, it’s about providing the best solutions.
