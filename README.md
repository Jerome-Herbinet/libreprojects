Collecting them makes it  easy to find available projects to use and contribute to – both users and developers profit from that. Everyone can help improve these services, not only by coding or translating but also by using and spreading the word.

Not every project will be listed here, especially not complicated  ones. It’s not about giving many choices, it’s about providing the best solutions.
